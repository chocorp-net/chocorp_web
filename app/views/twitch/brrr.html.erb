  <h1>Hi Twitch!</h1>
  <div>
    <p>I recently (Dec. 2020)  bought my first 3D-printer, an Ender 3 from Creality. It will start a stream on Twitch anytime I print something, and post a timelapse on Youtube. I'll also list here the models I'll be making.</p>

    The printer is currently printing <strong><%= "#{@job_name} " %></strong>! Check it out <%= link_to 'here', 'https://print.chocorp.net/#control' %> (credentials: guest/guest).
  <% elsif ! @is_alive %>
    The printer is likely off.

    The printer is not busy at the moment.
